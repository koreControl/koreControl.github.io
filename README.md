# KoreControl
This is an alpha release , There are a lot of bugs which need to be addressed.
models are not that strong , performance is highly dependant on your hardware, User can fine tune some params in the config files which can help.
We expect to get most bugs out by Beta release , which should be after we see the response from users.

presently for most leveling up use case we exapect it to be efficient enough , though nowhere close to Openkore.
KoreControl is Free to use , and we expect to cover up costs via running ADS, expect some ads depending on your region.
Please dont disable ads or use adblockers on your devices as that directly harms us, and there might not be a furthure release if we cant be profitable!

The bot should be able to navigate from last save point to the intended map specified in config files and respawn, currently in alpha we know it can get stuck in NPC dialogues or merchant Shops.
Item pick up is flaky , not relaible so farming is limited.
Skills can be used , follow the config file.
VK currently in alpha  cannot defferentiate between a player and the targets, resulting in getting stuck (This is priority uno in Beta).
So use in less populated maps.

As a general advice keep an eye on the bot!

Currently VisualKore cannot run on servers protected by gepard shield , that would be handled in Beta release too .
