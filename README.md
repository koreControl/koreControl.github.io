# VisualKore
This is an alpha release. There are a lot of bugs which need to be addressed.
The models are not that strong yet, and performance is highly dependent on your hardware. Users can fine-tune some parameters in the config files, which can help. We expect to get most bugs out by the Beta release, which should be planned after we see the response from users.

Presently, for most leveling-up use cases, we expect it to be efficient enough, though nowhere close to OpenKore. KoreControl is free to use, and we expect to cover costs by running ads. Expect some ads depending on your region. Please don’t disable ads or use ad blockers on your devices, as that directly harms us, and there might not be a future release if we can’t be profitable.

The bot should be able to navigate from the last save point to the intended map specified in the config files and respawn correctly. However, in the current alpha, we know it can get stuck in NPC dialogues or merchant shops. Item pickup is flaky and not reliable, so farming is limited. Skills can be used — follow the config file. VK currently, in alpha, cannot differentiate between players and targets, resulting in getting stuck (this is priority number one for Beta). Therefore, use it in less populated maps.

As a general rule, keep an eye on the bot.

Currently, VisualKore cannot run on servers protected by Gepard Shield. This will be handled in the Beta release as well.
